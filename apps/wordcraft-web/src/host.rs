//! Host modes: a page that runs WordCraft (as an `<iframe>`, or in its own document) opens
//! documents in it and stores what it saves instead of the browser downloading. The messages and
//! the two transports are `craft-web-host`'s (storytold/craft-libs), the same contract as the
//! other Craft apps' bridges, with the `wordcraft:` prefix. This module is WordCraft's part of it.
//!
//! - `?host=parent` (an `<iframe>`, such as a Nextcloud app) talks to the same-origin parent over
//!   `postMessage`; `data-host="page"` on the canvas (the page's own document, no iframe) uses
//!   DOM `CustomEvent`s on the canvas instead. `?host=parent` wins when both are present. With no
//!   parent, or a parent on another origin, there is no bridge: the normal app with downloads.
//! - `wordcraft:ready` once the app is running and listening; send a file now. WordCraft reads
//!   bytes, so it says `file: false` and a host sends `bytes`.
//! - `wordcraft:open` (from the host): `{ name, bytes }`. It opens like a document picked with
//!   File › Open or dropped on the window; a file over [`MAX_OPEN_BYTES`] is refused before it is
//!   copied.
//! - `wordcraft:save` (to the host): `{ name, saveAs, bytes }` for every file WordCraft would
//!   otherwise download. The host stores it and reports failures itself. `saveAs` says whether
//!   the file becomes the document's file:
//!   - Save: `false`. It writes the opened file under its own name and format, as the desktop
//!     app does. A name the parent never sent (an untitled document, an imported .doc saved as
//!     .docx) is a new file: `true`, as for Save As.
//!   - Save As, and File › Export to another document format (which runs Save As): `true` for a
//!     format that keeps everything (.docx and the other Word packages, .odt, .rtf). The document
//!     is now that file; the next Save sends its name with `false`.
//!   - Save As or Export to a format that doesn't (PDF, Markdown, plain text), Export as PDF and
//!     Export Page as PNG: `false`. They are copies; the document's file stays the same.
//! - `wordcraft:dirty` whenever unsaved changes appear or go away, `wordcraft:failed` when the
//!   app couldn't start.
//!
//! In both host modes the host sends the document to edit, so no sample opens, saves are handed
//! to the host rather than downloaded, the host guards leaving the page, and `?author=` names the
//! user for comments and tracked changes.
