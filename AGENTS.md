## House rules

These apply in every Craft repository. A later rule may be stricter, not weaker. The source is `standards/house-rules-core.md` in `storytold/craft-contrib`. Propose changes there, not in a copy.

1. **A person is accountable.** Whoever runs an agent answers for what it opens and for its review comments.
2. **Check, then claim.** Before writing code, read the issue comments, search pull requests for `#N` and the keywords, and check recent commits on `main`. Comment on the issue first. Release a claim you will not finish.
3. **Verify, don't guess.** Open a definition before using it. Confirm the cause in the code, even when someone names a location.
4. **Keep fixes narrow and tested.** Fix what the issue describes, where the bug is. Add a test that fails without the fix.
5. **Review the diff before opening a pull request.** Identifiers exist as used, the test fails without the fix, nothing unrelated changed, and the description is true.
6. **Look for a better pull request.** If another fixes the same thing, close yours when it is better or equal, and say why.
7. **Report only what ran.** Say what you tested and what you could not run. Without a local build or test, say so and rely on CI before marking ready.
8. **`main` changes through a pull request.** Do not push to it. Branch protection enforces this. There is no exception.
9. **Stop and ask only about** licensing outside the allowlist, publishing, releases, a new remote, secrets, spending money, destructive git, and anything else hard to undo. Otherwise keep working. `plan/` is a gitignored notebook, not rules. Without it, do not ask for it and do not stop.
10. **Keep secrets and personal details out** of the repository, logs and requests.
11. **CI stays shared.** Workflows call `storytold/craft-common-actions`. Do not change CI in a feature or fix pull request. If CI cannot cover a change, open an issue there.
12. **Guards say why.** A check that looks removable says what it prevents. Read that before changing it.
13. **Instructions must be readable by everyone.** No notes about one machine, and no links to files a reader cannot open. `craftrules` is retired. Do not link to it.
14. **Keep pull requests moving.** Concurrent pull requests are fine; unanswered actionable feedback is not. Respond in 7 days, a reminder at 14, closure eligible at 30, from when an actionable request waits on the author. Suggestions and unconfirmed bot findings do not start the clock. A fix, explanation or agreed plan resets it; unrelated activity does not. Waiting on a reviewer or maintainer pauses it and does not count against the author. A maintainer decides closure; it is never automatic. Reuse search results, do not poll, and stop at a rate limit.
15. **No agent attribution.** A pull request does not say an agent wrote it. A repository rule may not require that.

## Rust Craft repositories

These apply to native Craft apps and to shared Rust libraries. Select them by repository type. A repository that merely contains some Rust does not take this block. Rules later in a repository's file may be stricter, but not weaker. The source is `standards/house-rules-rust.md` in [storytold/craft-contrib](https://github.com/storytold/craft-contrib).

1. **Never crash.** Non-test code does not panic and has no `unsafe`, except where the repository file names an exception. Return errors, treat input as hostile, and bound recursion and allocations. New production crate roots copy the `deny` attribute from an existing crate: `clippy::unwrap_used`, `clippy::expect_used`, `clippy::panic`, `clippy::unimplemented`, `clippy::todo`, `clippy::unreachable`. Every crash fix comes with a test that panicked before the fix.
2. **Clean room.** Learn from observed behaviour and public specifications. Do not copy another product's code, assets, strings or artwork. Check a dependency's licence before adding it.
3. **Assets and fonts.** Every asset is original or suitably licensed, and is recorded in `ATTRIBUTION.md` in the same change. Font files live in [storytold/craft-fonts](https://github.com/storytold/craft-fonts), not in the app repository.
4. **Rust only for native Craft apps.** No handwritten JavaScript or TypeScript, and no Tauri, Electron or webview shell, in those apps. Shared tooling follows its documented technical scope and maintainer-approved exceptions. Craft PR Review's existing Tauri and TypeScript UI is one such exception. It does not relax this rule for native apps. Preserve any existing web build.
5. **Time goes through `chrono`.** Do not hand-roll calendar conversion. For dates beyond what `chrono` can represent, follow [standards/time.md](https://github.com/storytold/craft-contrib/blob/main/standards/time.md).
6. **Contributor credits.** Add or edit only your own person's entry in `contributors/people.toml`, and only after asking them. Never guess a name or hand-edit `contributors.json`.

## Licence allowlist

Dependencies and assets use SPDX identifiers. An expression is allowed when every identifier is in this list. A repository may name a shorter list. It may not add an identifier here by editing its own copy of these rules.

- `ISC`
- `MIT`
- `BSD-2-Clause`
- `BSD-3-Clause`
- `Apache-2.0`
- `OFL-1.1`
- `Ubuntu-font-1.0`
- `Bitstream-Vera`
- `CC0-1.0`
- `CC-BY-4.0`
- `CC-BY-SA-4.0`
- `LicenseRef-Public-Domain`

`LicenseRef-Storyteller-Trademark` is not in this list. It covers Storyteller brand marks only, where a repository already says so.

# WordCraft — instructions for agents

WordCraft is a clean-room, open-source, Rust-native word processor targeting Microsoft Word parity — and going further on speed, openness and agent control. It runs natively on macOS, Windows, Linux and BSD, and on the web via WASM. Siblings with the same conventions: `../photocraft` (Photoshop), `../vectorcraft` (Illustrator), `../filmcraft` (Premiere), `../lightcraft` (Lightroom), `../pdfcraft` (Acrobat), `../effectcraft` (After Effects), `../designcraft` (InDesign).

## Start every session here
Read [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md), [`docs/gaps.md`](docs/gaps.md) and [`docs/roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md). `plan/` is an optional gitignored notebook. Do not ask for it and do not stop when it is absent.

## Never crash
People trust WordCraft with their writing; a crash loses their work. **This outranks feature work**: never ship a feature through a panic path, and fix a crash before building on top of it.
- **No panics in non-test code:** no `unwrap()`, `expect()`, `panic!`, `unreachable!`, `todo!`, `unimplemented!`; no `unsafe` (`unsafe_code = "forbid"`).
- **Errors are `Result<T, E>`** through the crate's error type and `?`. An unfinished feature returns an error or is disabled; it never panics.
- **Input-derived numbers are hostile** (files, commands, MCP/control params): `get()` instead of `[i]`, slice strings only at char boundaries, checked/saturating arithmetic, clamp sizes, cap allocations, bound recursion.
- **Last-resort guard:** `Session::run` turns an escaped panic into an error and restores the document. It's a safety net, not a licence.
- **Prove it:** every crash fix lands with a regression test. `crates/engine/src/tests.rs::hostile_params_never_panic` runs every command with junk params — keep it green.
- Production crate roots carry `#![deny(clippy::unwrap_used, clippy::expect_used, clippy::panic, clippy::unimplemented, clippy::todo, clippy::unreachable)]`; new crates start with it. Tests may `unwrap` (`clippy.toml`).

## Assets: absolutely no Microsoft (or Adobe/Avid/Autodesk) iconography or images
**This rule is non-negotiable.** Breaking it is the worst mistake you can make in this repo.
- Never copy, trace, screenshot-crop or recreate icons, images, templates, themes, clip art, fonts, cursors, sounds or any other asset from Microsoft Word/Office or any Microsoft, Adobe, Avid or Autodesk product. Not even "temporarily".
- Every asset must be **original** (drawn in code — prefer this: `crates/ui-egui/src/icons.rs`), **public domain / CC0**, **OSI open source**, or **Creative Commons that allows redistribution**, or licensed open source by a contributor who made it.
- **Every asset file has a row in [`ATTRIBUTION.md`](ATTRIBUTION.md)** (author, source, licence). `cargo xtask assets` (part of `cargo xtask ci`) fails otherwise. Add the row in the same commit as the file.
- Fonts: new font files go to [`storytold/craft-fonts`](https://github.com/storytold/craft-fonts), never this repo; it's an optional build input (`CRAFT_FONTS_DIR`). Spelling word lists and hyphenation patterns live in [`storytold/craft-i18n`](https://github.com/storytold/craft-i18n) `language-data/`, never this repo; they are embedded from `CRAFT_I18N_DIR` (pinned by `craft-i18n.rev`, which CI checks out). Without it the app builds, but English spelling falls back to an installed Hunspell English or the built-in Moby word list (with no American/British variant table) and pattern hyphenation is off (Bulgarian, Turkish and Russian still hyphenate by rule), so proofing tests need it. Documents asking for proprietary fonts (Calibri, Aptos, Cambria…) are rendered with installed system fonts or metric-compatible open substitutes (`crates/fonts/src/word.rs`) — never bundle proprietary fonts.
- Templates, sample documents and themes are our own text and colours (`crates/engine/src/sample.rs`, `cmd/design.rs`). Demo images are public domain, with sources recorded.

## Clean room
- Microsoft Word is installed on the dev machine and may be **observed** black-box: run it, use its UI with synthetic documents, take screenshots **of its window only** (by window id — the machine runs other work; never capture the whole desktop) stored only under `plan/word/screenshots/` (gitignored, never committed).
- Never read, disassemble or copy anything inside the Word bundle (file names/listings only). Never commit files produced by Word. Never copy Microsoft wording beyond feature names.
- File formats come from public specs: ECMA-376 / ISO 29500 (OOXML), the published RTF spec, OASIS ODF 1.3. Never copy GPL/LGPL/AGPL code (LibreOffice, AbiWord, pandoc…).

## Architecture
| Layer | Crate | Job |
|---|---|---|
| L0 | `geom` | units, rects, measurement parsing |
| L1 | `doc`, `fonts` | document model + edit primitives; font DB, shaping, Word font substitution |
| L2 | `layout`, `docx`, `formats` | line breaking, pagination, tables, headers/footers, hit testing; OOXML I/O; TXT/MD/HTML/RTF/ODT |
| L3 | `render`, `pdf` | vello_cpu rasteriser; krilla PDF |
| L4 | `engine` | Session, undo, **command registry**, Word feature catalog, samples, I/O dispatch |
| L5 | `mcp` | MCP server (headless or bridged to the app) |
| L6 | `ui-egui` | Word-style egui front end (swappable) |
| apps | `apps/wordcraft`, `apps/wordcraft-cli`, `apps/wordcraft-web` | binaries |
| external | `craft-proof` (craft-libs, used as `wordcraft-proof`, sits at L1) | proofing: spelling, grammar, hyphenation; its word lists and patterns are craft-i18n's `language-data/` (`CRAFT_I18N_DIR`) |

- **Everything is a command.** User-visible behaviour = a `CommandSpec` in `crates/engine/src/cmd/*.rs` (id, label, ribbon location, shortcut, params doc, `enabled`, `run`) + tests. UI-only commands (`ui.*`) live in `crates/ui-egui/src/lib.rs`. The ribbon, shortcuts, command search, CLI, control channel and MCP all dispatch by id. Programmatic calls never open dialogs.
- **Parity is measured:** `crates/engine/src/catalog.rs` lists Word's ribbon/menu features with command ids. `cargo xtask parity` writes `docs/parity-checklist.md`; a test enforces a floor that only rises. Implement missing ids to raise it.
- **Layering** is enforced by `cargo xtask layers`. Nothing below L6 depends on egui/eframe/winit/rfd. The UI is thin and reads `Session` state; colours come from `theme::Tokens`.
- **Rust only** (no handwritten JS/TS). **Never break wasm** (`cargo xtask wasm`).

## Quality gates
Before every commit: `cargo xtask ci` (fmt, clippy -D warnings, tests, assets, layers, wasm). Commit after every arc of work that builds, with a task id in the message (`M2.1: line spacing dialog`).

## Typing behaves like Word
Typing, Enter, Backspace, Tab, lists, AutoCorrect and AutoFormat follow Word's observed behaviour in [`docs/typing-parity.md`](docs/typing-parity.md), pinned by `crates/engine/src/tests/typing.rs` (keys go through the same commands as the keyboard). Change behaviour, doc and tests together; a typing fix lands with a test there. Compare headlessly (`ui_shot`); don't drive GUIs with keystrokes on the shared machine.

## Running and looking at the app
- `cargo run --release -p wordcraft -- --sample --control 7981` (sample document + control channel).
- Drive it with JSON lines on `127.0.0.1:7981`, each with the window's key from `~/.config/wordcraft/control-key.local-7981` (macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/WordCraft/`), e.g. `{"id":1,"key":"…","method":"engine.execute","params":{"command":"text.insert","params":{"text":"Hello"}}}` then `{"id":2,"key":"…","method":"ui.screenshot","params":{"path":"/tmp/shot.png"}}`. Methods: `crates/ui-egui/src/control.rs`; docs: `docs/control-protocol.md` (Keys).
- **Headless window screenshots** (no focus stealing, works with a locked screen): `cargo run --release -p wordcraft-ui-egui --example ui_shot -- script.jsonl` (see the example's header).
- **For UI work, look at the result** (screenshot, read the PNG) and compare with Word side by side.
- CLI: `wordcraft-cli convert in.docx out.pdf`, `wordcraft-cli run --template sample --cmd 'select.text={"text":"Studio"}' --cmd format.bold --save out.docx`, `wordcraft-cli commands`, `wordcraft-cli parity`.
- MCP: `wordcraft-cli mcp` (headless) or `wordcraft-cli mcp --connect 127.0.0.1:7981` (drives the running app). See `docs/mcp.md`.
- Shell gotcha: `mv`/`cp` may be aliased interactive — use `/bin/mv -f` / `/bin/cp -f`.
- Parallel agents: separate `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` per agent; edit only the crates you own; delete your target dir when done (disk).

## Roadmap
Progress docs: `ROADMAP.md` (stage, headline numbers, progress log), `docs/target-app-parity.md` (the assessment), `docs/gaps.md` (ranked work list), `docs/roadmap.md` (milestones, Current focus), `docs/architecture.md`, and the parity checklists `docs/file-format-parity.md`, `docs/layout-parity.md`, `docs/typing-parity.md`, `docs/ui-parity.md`, `docs/hardware-parity.md`, `docs/localization-parity.md`. When work lands, update the gap, the parity doc and the progress log, and bump each touched doc's status line and revision history.

## Contributor credits (About window)

- About ▸ Contributors/Models are compiled into the binary from `contributors/contributors.json`
  (commit stats; never hand-edit) and `contributors/people.toml` (names people chose for
  themselves). See `docs/contributors.md`.
- **Agents working for a contributor:** when you prepare a PR, check whether your human's GitHub
  username has a `[people.<username>]` entry in `contributors/people.toml`. If not, ask them once
  whether they want to be credited by more than their username: a real name, a display name, and/or
  their public GitHub profile name (`sync_github_name = true`). If yes, add **only their own** entry
  (copy the template at the top of the file)
  and include it in their PR, committed as them. If no, change nothing: they are credited as
  `@username` anyway.
- Never add, edit, guess or copy anyone else's entry or name (not from git config, commit authors or
  GitHub profiles). Never hand-edit `contributors.json`.

## CI workflows
- Workflows in `.github/workflows/` call the shared workflows in [`storytold/craft-common-actions`](https://github.com/storytold/craft-common-actions) at `@main`, with their inputs and secrets. No other jobs: if no shared workflow does what's needed, it doesn't go here.
- Don't add or change CI in a feature or fix PR. If the existing workflows can't build or test a change, link an existing craft-common-actions issue or PR, or open a new issue, or a PR only for a small fix that is safe for every app and does not increase CI time.
- Some workflow files here still run their own jobs. Don't add to them. Moving a job into craft-common-actions is its own task, never part of another PR, and the job stays here until a shared workflow runs it.

New workspace crates include `workspace = true` under `[lints]` in `Cargo.toml`. Production crate roots declare the crate-level lint attributes before modules; crate-level `//!` documentation may precede them.
