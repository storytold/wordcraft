# macOS IME commit state

This patch adapts source PR [pdfcraft #676](https://github.com/storytold/pdfcraft/pull/676)
and upstream [winit #4650](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/pull/4650) to the
vendored winit 0.30.13 baseline. It preserves commits that follow cleared marked
text and delivers text committed outside a key press. The structural guard is
`apps/wordcraft/tests/winit_macos_ime_commit.rs`.
