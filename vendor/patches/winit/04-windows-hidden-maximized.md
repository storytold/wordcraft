# Hidden maximized Windows startup

This patch adapts source PR [pdfcraft #674](https://github.com/storytold/pdfcraft/pull/674)
and upstream [winit #4587](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/pull/4587) to the
vendored winit 0.30.13 baseline. A hidden maximized window is shown with one
`SW_MAXIMIZE`, avoiding a visible unpainted frame before the first application
frame. The structural guard is `apps/wordcraft/tests/winit_windows_hidden_maximized.rs`.
