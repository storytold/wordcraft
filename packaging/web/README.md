# Hosting WordCraft for the web

`wordcraft-web-<version>.zip` (from the GitHub release, or `packaging/web/package.sh`) holds a
static site in `wordcraft-web-<version>/`:

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | The page. It loads everything through relative URLs. |
| `wordcraft-web-<hash>.js` | wasm-bindgen glue (generated, ES module) |
| `wordcraft-web-<hash>_bg.wasm` | The app, about 13 MB, or 5 MB with compression |
| `manifest.webmanifest` | Install metadata and the document types the installed app opens |
| `icons/256x256/`, `icons/512x512/` | The app icons the manifest names |
| `_headers`, `.htaccess` | Sample header rules for Netlify/Cloudflare Pages and Apache |

There is no server-side code. Upload the folder's contents anywhere that serves static files.

## Any path works

All URLs in `index.html` are relative (`public_url = "./"` in `apps/wordcraft-web/Trunk.toml`),
so the site works at a domain root (`https://example.com/`), under a prefix
(`https://example.com/tools/wordcraft/`) and from a CDN bucket. The asset names carry a content
hash, so they can be cached forever. Only `index.html` and `manifest.webmanifest` need
revalidation. The manifest has no `id`, so its relative `start_url` names the app: copies under
different prefixes install as different apps.

## Required server settings

- **MIME type:** serve `.wasm` as `application/wasm`. Browsers refuse to stream-compile it under
  any other type, and the app then loads slowly or not at all. Serve `.js` as `text/javascript`
  and `.webmanifest` as `application/manifest+json`. Most hosts already do all three. For nginx,
  check that `mime.types` has `application/wasm wasm;` and `application/manifest+json webmanifest;`.
- **Compression:** turn on gzip or Brotli for `.wasm`, `.js` and `.html`. That takes the
  download from about 13 MB to about 5 MB. You can also precompress (`brotli -k *.wasm`) and let
  the server send `Content-Encoding: br`.
- **Caching:** `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` on the hashed `.wasm` and
  `.js` files, and `no-cache` on `index.html`.
- **HTTPS:** WebGPU (and the clipboard) only work in a secure context, which means `https://`
  or `http://localhost`. Over plain HTTP elsewhere, the app falls back to WebGL2.
- **No special isolation headers:** WordCraft doesn't use `SharedArrayBuffer`, so it doesn't
  need `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` or `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy`. If your site already sends
  COEP `require-corp`, also send `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin` (or `cross-origin`
  when the files live on a CDN) on the app's files.

nginx example:

```nginx
location /wordcraft/ {
    types { application/wasm wasm; text/javascript js; text/html html; application/manifest+json webmanifest; }
    gzip on;
    gzip_types application/wasm text/javascript text/html;
    location ~* \.(wasm|js)$ { add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"; }
    location ~* (index\.html|manifest\.webmanifest)$ { add_header Cache-Control "no-cache"; }
}
```

Local test: `python3 -m http.server 8765` inside the folder, then open http://localhost:8765/.

## Installing it as an app

Over HTTPS, Chrome and Edge offer to install the page as an app (the install icon in the address
bar, or the menu's Install WordCraft). On ChromeOS it then sits in the launcher, and on Windows,
macOS and Linux in the system's app list, and opens in a window of its own.

The installed app opens Word, OpenDocument, RTF, Markdown, LaTeX and HTML documents from the
system's file manager (Open with › WordCraft). Each file opens beside the documents already open,
as a dropped file does; none replaces unsaved work. The app reads the file but can't write to it:
Save asks where to save, as it does for any document opened in the browser. Files open one at a
time, each up to 256 MB; at most 20 wait to be opened, and the app says how many more it left out.

Browsers without installable apps or file handling (Firefox, Safari) run the page as before. An
app in an iframe (`?host=parent`) doesn't take files from the system: its host page sends them.

## Embedding in a page (iframe)

```html
<iframe
  src="https://example.com/wordcraft/"
  title="WordCraft image editor"
  style="width: 100%; height: 720px; border: 0;"
  allow="fullscreen; clipboard-read; clipboard-write"
  allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
```

- The app fills the iframe and follows its size, so size the iframe and not the app.
- Keyboard shortcuts go to the iframe after the user clicks into it, as with any embedded app.
- **Cross-origin embeds** work. Preferences are kept in the iframe's `localStorage`. Browsers
  that partition or block third-party storage may forget them between visits, and the app
  then starts with defaults.
- **Sandboxed iframes** need at least
  `sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-downloads allow-popups"`. Without
  `allow-same-origin` there's no storage. Without `allow-downloads`, Save and Export (browser
  downloads) are blocked.
- Don't send `X-Frame-Options: DENY` or a `frame-ancestors` CSP that excludes the embedding page.

## Renderer selection and fallback flags

WordCraft renders with wgpu. It uses **WebGPU** when the browser has it and falls back to
**WebGL2** on its own. URL query flags override this, and they work on the iframe `src` too:

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| *(none)* | WebGPU if available, otherwise WebGL2 |
| `?webgl` | Force the WebGL2 backend (useful when a WebGPU driver misbehaves) |

For example: `<iframe src="https://example.com/wordcraft/?webgl" ...>`.

A browser with neither WebGPU nor WebGL2 gets a message in place of the app.
