## Why WordCraft

- **Familiar.** Word's ribbon tabs, groups, shortcuts and behaviour: Enter continues a list,
  Tab demotes it, Ctrl/⌘+B bolds the word under the caret, the Styles gallery previews styles live,
  F4 repeats, F7 checks spelling, F8 extends the selection.
- **Your files.** Opens and saves .docx (OOXML), and also .odt, .rtf, .html, .md, .txt; exports PDF
  with real, selectable text, links and bookmarks.
- **Fast.** Paragraph layout is cached, so typing in a 188-page document re-lays it out in about
  1.4 ms; pages render on demand.
- **Everywhere.** One Rust codebase for macOS, Windows, Linux, BSD and the web. No Electron, no
  Tauri: native [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) on the GPU.
- **Built for agents.** Every action is a command with an id. The same 389 commands drive the
  ribbon, keyboard shortcuts, the command search, a command-line tool, a JSON control channel and
  an MCP server.
- **Private.** Spelling, grammar and everything else work offline.
- **Open.** MIT OR Apache-2.0. Clean-room: built from public specifications and observation, with
  every asset original or openly licensed.

The honest picture, area by area, is in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) and the generated
[feature parity report](docs/parity.md).

## Quick start

```sh
git clone https://github.com/storytold/wordcraft
cd wordcraft
cargo run --release -p wordcraft -- --sample        # the desktop app with the sample document
cargo run --release -p wordcraft -- report.docx     # open a document
```

Command line:

```sh
wordcraft-cli convert report.docx report.pdf        # docx, pdf, odt, rtf, html, md, txt, png
wordcraft-cli text report.docx                      # plain text
wordcraft-cli inspect report.docx                   # structure as JSON
wordcraft-cli run --template sample \
  --cmd 'select.text={"text":"Membership"}' --cmd format.bold --save out.docx
```

Web: `cd apps/wordcraft-web && trunk serve`, then open <http://127.0.0.1:8771/?sample>.

Each [GitHub release](https://github.com/storytold/wordcraft/releases) has ready-made builds, on Linux as an AppImage, a `.deb`, an `.rpm` and a tarball. On Gentoo, the community [::snakebyte overlay](https://github.com/switch87/snakebyte-overlay) packages the Linux release as `app-office/wordcraft-bin` (not maintained by the WordCraft team):

```sh
eselect repository add snakebyte git https://github.com/switch87/snakebyte-overlay.git
emaint sync -r snakebyte
echo 'app-office/wordcraft-bin ~amd64' >> /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/wordcraft
emerge --ask app-office/wordcraft-bin
```

## For agents: CLI and MCP

WordCraft was designed to be driven by people *and* by AI agents.

```sh
claude mcp add wordcraft -- wordcraft-cli mcp                  # headless documents
wordcraft --control 7981 &                                     # or drive the running app…
claude mcp add wordcraft-app -- wordcraft-cli mcp --connect 127.0.0.1:7981
```

Tools include `list_commands`, `execute`, `batch`, `type_text`, `select_text`, `inspect_document`,
`render_page`, `save_document`, and, with a running app, `screenshot`, `click` and `key`. Agents
can check their work through `inspect_document` without screenshots. See [docs/mcp.md](docs/mcp.md)
and the [control protocol](docs/control-protocol.md). Macros record any sequence of commands and
play it back (`tools.recordMacro`, `tools.macros`).

## Logs

The desktop app writes its log records to standard error and to `logs/wordcraft.log` next to its
preferences: on Linux `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wordcraft/logs/` (by default `~/.config/wordcraft/logs/`),
on macOS `~/Library/Application Support/WordCraft/logs/`, on Windows `%APPDATA%\WordCraft\logs\`.
A start from a desktop menu or the Dock has no terminal, so this file is what to attach to a bug
report: unreadable parts of a .docx, pictures or fonts a PDF export had to leave out and panics the
command guard recovered from land there. Each launch moves the previous log to `wordcraft.1.log`
(and that one to `wordcraft.2.log`), so the log of a run that crashed survives the next start; a
log stops growing at 16 MiB. `--version` writes no file, and runs with `WORDCRAFT_NO_PREFS` (agents'
test runs) log to standard error only. Document text is never logged; a panic message leaves out
the text it quotes.

By default WordCraft's own crates log at `info` and everything else at `warn`. `RUST_LOG` replaces
that with env_logger-style directives, for example `RUST_LOG=debug`,
`RUST_LOG=warn,wordcraft_docx=trace` or `RUST_LOG=info,wgpu_core=warn`; a directive ending in `*`
covers every target starting with it (`wordcraft*=debug`). The logger is
`apps/wordcraft/src/logging.rs`.

## Architecture

| Layer | Crate | Job |
|---|---|---|
| L0 | `wordcraft-geom` | units and measurements |
| L1 | `wordcraft-doc`, `wordcraft-fonts`, `wordcraft-proof` | document model and editing; fonts and shaping; spelling, grammar, hyphenation |
| L2 | `wordcraft-layout`, `wordcraft-docx`, `wordcraft-formats` | line breaking, pagination, tables, notes, hit testing; OOXML; ODT/RTF/HTML/Markdown/TXT |
| L3 | `wordcraft-render`, `wordcraft-pdf` | rasteriser (vello_cpu); PDF (krilla) |
| L4 | `wordcraft-engine` | session, undo, 389 commands, Word feature catalog |
| L5 | `wordcraft-mcp` | MCP server |
| L6 | `wordcraft-ui-egui` | the Word-style front end (swappable) |
| apps | `wordcraft`, `wordcraft-cli`, `wordcraft-web` | desktop, command line, browser |

`cargo xtask ci` runs formatting, clippy, ~250 tests, the asset-attribution check, the layering
check and the wasm build. Contributor and agent instructions: [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Roadmap

WordCraft covers 87% of Word's ribbon features with commands today; counting depth and
fidelity, we estimate about 62% of real feature parity. An alpha for everyday writing is close:
the remaining work is mostly testing against real-world .docx files, native printing and the
first signed builds. Charts, SmartArt, the equation editor and the Draw tab come after.
Details and estimates: [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

## Downloads

**Download WordCraft** from GitHub: the [latest release](https://github.com/storytold/wordcraft/releases/latest) has every build listed below, and [all releases](https://github.com/storytold/wordcraft/releases) has earlier versions and their notes. `<ver>` in the file names is the version number, and `SHA256SUMS.txt` lists a checksum for every file.

### Windows

| Build | Installer | Portable |
|---|---|---|
| x64 (64-bit Intel/AMD) | `wordcraft-<ver>-windows-x64.msi` | `wordcraft-<ver>-windows-x64-portable.zip` |
| arm64 (Snapdragon and other ARM PCs) | `wordcraft-<ver>-windows-arm64.msi` | `wordcraft-<ver>-windows-arm64-portable.zip` |
| x86 (32-bit) | `wordcraft-<ver>-windows-x86.msi` | `wordcraft-<ver>-windows-x86-portable.zip` |

Installers and executables are code-signed.

**If the app doesn't open on Windows:** the desktop app initializes only DirectX 12 by default.
Letting wgpu also create an OpenGL instance can crash some graphics drivers (AMD's
`atio6axx.dll`) before the window appears, so the app would flash in Task Manager and quit.
`WGPU_BACKEND` overrides the default for troubleshooting (for example `dx12` or `vulkan`). In
PowerShell, from the folder containing the executable:

```powershell
$env:WGPU_BACKEND = "vulkan"
& .\wordcraft.exe
Remove-Item Env:WGPU_BACKEND                     # restore the default for later launches
```

An explicit `gl` override can bring the driver crash back on affected systems. The macOS, Linux
and web backend defaults are unchanged.

### macOS

| Build | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| App, universal (Apple silicon + Intel) | `wordcraft-<ver>-macos-universal.dmg` | Signed and notarized |
| Command-line tool, universal | `wordcraft-cli-<ver>-macos-universal.zip` | Signed and notarized |

### Linux

| Format | x86_64 | aarch64 (ARM64) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|

| Flatpak | `wordcraft-<ver>-linux-x86_64.flatpak` | `wordcraft-<ver>-linux-aarch64.flatpak` | Sandboxed; `flatpak install --user <file>` |
| Debian/Ubuntu | `wordcraft-<ver>-linux-x86_64.deb` | `wordcraft-<ver>-linux-aarch64.deb` | |
| Fedora/RHEL/openSUSE | `wordcraft-<ver>-linux-x86_64.rpm` | `wordcraft-<ver>-linux-aarch64.rpm` | |

### FreeBSD

| Build | File |
|---|---|

### Web (WebAssembly)

| Build | File | Notes |
